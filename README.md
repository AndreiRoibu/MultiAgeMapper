# MultiAgeMapper

This is a working release of MultiAgeMapper, a collection of multi-modal 3D neural networks for brain age prediction. For any issues, please contact Andrei Roibu at andrei-claudiu.roibu@dtc.ox.ac.uk. 

The code is still undergoing modifications and further additions will be made in the coming period.

This work is a continuation of the work conducted in AgeMapper: https://github.com/AndreiRoibu/AgeMapper

## Motivation (From PhD Thesis)

This repository presents the code and methodologies developed in my PhD thesis, focusing on the exploration of brain ageing through advanced neuroimaging techniques. The core of this work involves leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on various 3D neuroimaging modalities to predict brain ageing. A significant finding of this research is the impact of different ensembling strategies, both linear and non-linear, on the predictive accuracy and interpretability of brain ageing models. The code notably explores the potential of non-linear ensembling methods, such as multi-modal deep fusion neural networks, to enhance the extraction of information from neuroimaging data by exploiting complementary features between modalities. Various fusion strategies are evaluated and compared against traditional linear ensembling methods like ElasticNet, leading to insights about the convergence and stability of brain-ageing models.

## Network Architecture & Pre-Trained Networks


## Subject Datasets and Contrast Information

To access the datasets utilised for training these networks, see the various text and numpy files in the __datasets__ folder in this repository. The actual MRI scans are available upon application from the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk), such as all the other data utilised in this project. 

In the __datasets__ there is also a file named __scaling_values_simple.csv__. This CSV file contains information on the name of each of the contrasts, the scale factor utilised during data pre-processing, the resolution of the MRI files, and the internal UK Biobank file handle marking where the file can be found for each subject.

## Correlations to UK Biobank nIDPs

One of the major findings of this work has been that all contrasts correlate significantly and differently with a large number of nIDPs from the UK Biobank. The correlations and the information for accessing the data is made freely available for the research community to further investigate. All the correlations can be accessed at on ***LINK TO BE ADDED LATER*** This collection contains both the full correlation, very large files, as well as smaller files, containing only the statistically significant associations. 

## Installation & Usage
To download and run this code as python files, you can clone this repository using git:

```bash
git clone <link to repo>
```

In order to install the required packages, the user will need the presence of Python3 and the [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installer. 

For installation on Linux or OSX, use the following commands. This will create a virtual environment and automatically install all the requirements, as well as create the required metadata

```bash
./setup.sh
```

In order to run the code, activate the previously installed virtual environment, and utilise the run file. Several steps are needed prior to that:
* make a copy of the __settings.ini__ and __settings_eval.ini__ files, filling out the required settings. If running an evaluation, make sure that the pre-trained network name corresponds to the experiment names
* rename the two __ini__ files to either the pre-trained network name, or to something else

This approach has been used given the large number of hyperparameters and network-subject sex-MRI modality combinations.

After setting up, activate your environment using the following code:

```bash
~/(usr)$ source env/bin/activate
```

For running network training epochs, utilise this code, setting TASK='train' (or test), NAME='name_of_your_ini_files', CHECKPOINT='0' (or some other value if wishing to start from a later checkpoint), and EPOCHS='number_of_epochs_you_want_to_train_for'. For more details on these inputs, see the __run.py__ file.

```bash
~/(usr)$ python run.py -m ${TASK} -n ${NAME} -c ${CHECKPOINT} -e ${EPOCHS}
```
